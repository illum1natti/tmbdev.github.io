Tom's Github Repositories
==========================

I'm a researcher at NVIDIA, working on petascale deep learning, self-supervised
training, text recognition, causality and sequence modeling, and the 
connection between statistics and deep learnining.

Prior to NVIDIA, I worked at Google Brain, Xerox PARC, and IBM Research.
I was a tenured professor of computer science at the University of
Kaiserslautern, heading a large research group working on image understanding
and machine learning. Among others, my group developed cancer detection,
OCR and text recognition, and image segmentation techniques based on deep
learning techniques in the 2000s.
